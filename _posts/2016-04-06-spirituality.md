Anything that has a cost raises the question of whether it is worth
it. Is the can of coke worth the empty calories? Is the higher salary worth the
extra hours spent at work? Is the joy of having kids worth the extra responsbility?
We make all sorts of small trade-offs in our lives, where we sacrifice something
in the pursuit of another. But some things are so challenging that on the face
of it, and by any metric you might think of, they are not worth the effort.
Sometimes, it could be life itself. In such circumstances, I believe in
the necessity of spirituality. A higher purpose that drives you and keeps you
going, that is not a derivative of some other purpose. Almost like an axiom of sorts.

For some people, this spirituality might be provided by religion, and they
are all the better for it. This is a very personal decision, and is subjective
by definition. I was raised a catholic, but I find it hard to reconcile many
of the beliefs with the way I understand the world. However, I too need some
kind of spirituality, because I am not excused from human suffering.

In my efforts to search for some kind of spiritual system (or in my spiritual quest,
if you prefer), I have found that there are few things which I have to insist upon.
The first is that the system does not make any descriptive claims about the world,
for that is the domain of science, and I do not want to mix the two.
The second, which is related to the first, is that the system should not introduce
wishful thinking -- there are real horrors in the world, whether we like it or not.
A consequence of this is that the spirituality should not claim to *solve* the
problems of everyday life.

I ended up settling on an idea from a scene in [Jurassic World][jurassic],
where the owner of the park Simon Masrani reminds Claire, who is in charge of
the operations of the park:

> Don't forget why we built this place, Claire.
Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are.

Being small. Being part of something larger. This, I think, is the basis of my spirituality.
