I'm in the last three weeks of undergrad, which makes this the perfect time to reflect on the past few years. I am a firm believer in having regrets, because to regret is to have learned something from the past. Imagine a life with no regrets. That means you were doing everything exactly right from the start, or you still have yet to learn what you have done wrong. Which one seems more likely?

First, some background. I almost flunked out of high school, and only got into CMU through a combination of luck, transfer applications and some hard work. This gave me a chip on my shoulder, and also a very bad "prerequisites" situation. The combination of these two things made me take my school work very seriously. I was not concerned about joining student organizations at all -- my only priority was to get a very good grounding through my core Computer Science classes. For the same reasons, I was also very conservative in my course load. I did well academically because I put in the time and the work. I have to add it was during this period that I felt I had to learn web development in order to get hired. So in my spare time, I learned the nuts-and-bolts of creating a website, hosting it on a server, etc.

I really enjoyed the bigger programming assignments in my introduction to systems class, so when it was time for me to choose my upper-level electives, I decided I was a systems guy. Unsurprisingly, I really enjoyed taking the systems electives. I helped out with a database research project, which was fun, although I did not put in as much time as I would have liked because of classes. The CMU Computer Science department has a minor requirement for undergrads. At this point, I decided to minor in machine learning, and took a few statistics and machine learning classes.

I then went through what I can only describe as a "phase-transition", a kind of mid-college crisis, where I lost a bit of my original purpose, and felt like I was missing out on other aspects of college life. For a semester, I dropped most of my school work to do other things. It is a miracle that my GPA survived intact (through some course dropping/pass-failing voodoo). I even considered dropping out at some point. Thankfully, to the relief of my parents, advisor and friends, I decided to stay in school. Even though in hindsight I went a bit "crazy" during this period, I feel that it was something I had to go through. It was during this period where I found myself in very strange situations, made many new friends, and acquired a new sense of spirituality.

After this period, I went back into school mode. I decided to get an additional major in Statistics, instead of a  minor in Machine Learning, partly because Statistics seemed further away from Computer Science and so more exotic. I also had to fulfill the more theoretrical electives. I took a class on computability, and it was absolutely mind expanding.

I also did three internships during undergrad. The first one was in Bangalore (where all the software outsourcing goes to), the second one was at Google and the third at Facebook. I worked with amazing people, learned a lot about software engineering as a skill in itself, and how software in the real world works. I also gained a sense of how different places have different cultures and put values on different things.

# Regrets

__Research/Side Projects__

One of biggest regrets was being too focused on classes, particularly at the expense of exploring side interests. Scott Fahlman calls this the [4.0 disease][scottfahlman]. Dave Anderson gives [similar advice][dga]:

> I wish I could advise entire generations of prospective Ph.D. students to spend more effort going deep into something that really interests them -- research, a startup, something -- and less time "doing well in" every class under the sun.  The depth is where you get to shine and to differentiate yourself, and to find out if it's something you like enough to devote 4-6 years of your life to.  It's also where you get to show that you can do things on your own, where you have to think creatively, where the answer isn't known in advance and might not even exist.

It was very hard for me to justify working on something for the next few hours that will in all likelihood not lead anywhere, over a class assignment that was due in three days. Looking at this from an optimization perspective,
I was consistently stuck in a local minimum and was not exploring the search space fully. [Simulated annealing][simanneal] might have been a better strategy.

__Required courses__

I decided I was a systems guy way too early. I am still very much interested in software systems, but I wish I had more time to learn about complexity and computability. I did not look forward to doing my required complexity elective, but it has opened up a whole new world and way of thinking. There is a reason it is a required category. Professors wiser than me have made it so, and for good reason.
  
__Courses Not Taken__

I specifically regret not having taken [Principles of Programming Languages][15312]. I hear of this fabled type theory, and how programming languages are type systems, but know nothing of it. Also [Parallel Computing][15418], which seems like it will only become more important (especially with the rise of deep learning).

__Web Development/Being Professional__

If I knew how small a part of the world of software web development actually is, I would not have spent so much time worrying about learning it outside of class when I was starting out. It is a very practical and useful skill though, but definitely not something worth stressing over. Also, in general, I would say learning fundamental things is more important than learning "professional things" (e.g. interviewing skills). All these always take up too much mindshare than they are worth, at least in software. Things might be very different though, if you are trying to transition into software, not having studied it for four years.

# Non-regrets

__Personal Exploration__

Taking some time off to re-center and evaluate higher goals is always worthwhile. I do not regret that one semester where I dropped most my school work to explore. In the midst of the daily grind of existence, it is sometimes nice to stop, look around, and appreciate the beauty. That makes it worthwhile.

__Internships__

To counterweight what I said about learning fundamental things vs "professional things", I think everyone should do at least one internship. It is always useful to have real-world perspective on things.
  
__Not taking easy courses__

I always tried to take hard classes that I was interested in. And I also tried (almost always) not to take easy classes just because they were easy. I think a better metric would be effort-to-reward ratio. Instead of looking for easy classes to balance out hard ones, better to look for classes with good effort-to-reward ratios.

# Afterthoughts

My college education was totally worthwhile, and I would not trade it for anything. It has been one of the most humbling experiences, where I have faced so many challenging problems and met so many smart people. In all of my classes, I have always been wowed by my professors and peers. If I had one sentence to say to myself before starting out, the only thing I can think of is, your adventure awaits.

Note that I'm not speaking from a perspective of value per dollar, or if it's worth college debt or anything, but if you are fortunate enough that money is not a consideration in your education, totally worth.
