    * Basic abstraction
    * Things cancelling out
 
- Calculus
    * Gradients, Rates of Change
    * Higher Order
    * Maximization/minimization

- Statistics/Machine Learning
    * Assumptions
    * Bias vs Variance
    * No Free Lunch

- Computability
    * Foundations
    * Syntax vs Semantics
    * Assign computational meaning
    * Mechanical
    * Contradiction of self-reference
    * Reducibility
    * Oracles
    * Undecidability

- Linear Algebra
    * Subspaces
    * Dimensionality
    * Basis vectors

- Graph Theory
    * Language of networks

- Abstract Algebra (Don't know anything about this)
    * Said to be The Great Simplifier - why does it mean?
