title:  "Why Blog?"

[Someone][yegge] suggested it. I've read many of Paul Graham's [essays][pg]
over the years and have recently been reading Cosma Shalizi's [notebooks][cosma].
I guess I'm secretly hoping that if I blog, I too will eventually have such
profound insights. We all can dream...

I intend to organize my writings by topic, and not by chronological order. The
idea is for each post to keep track of views on each topic, which will probably
change over time.
