Is music so enjoyable because it is "tickling" the pattern-matching
circuitry in our brains?

# To think about:

  Musical tone - periodic because of harmonic frequencies

  Age

    Ability to match patterns diminishes

  Music preferences

    preference for different patterns

  Vision

    We expect highly structured input already. But not so much for sound.

  Dancing

    Visualization of sound

    Transformation of waves in air to body movements.
