Parents, grandparents, siblings, girlfriend. We grow, we fight, we laugh, we cry.

Friend, best friend, old friend, acquaintance. Good moments, good memories we
never forget.

Rival, ex-girlfriend, former friend, former enemy. Life is not so simple
sometimes.

School, friend groups, teams, community. Complicated and more abstract, but
still not without feeling.

Work, sports, hobbies, quests. Are these not relationships too?

Self, other, life, death. Does the part exist without the whole?
