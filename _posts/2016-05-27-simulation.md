Computer Science is a field with both theoretical and engineering aspects.
The most obvious relationship between them is theory aiding in engineering. For example, algorithms and data structures, or automata theory for regular expressions. But engineering can also aid in theory, and one of the ways is through simulations.

By implementing some kind of system and watching how it unfolds over time, or in response to some stimulus, we can build intuition about the system itself. This [book][cbn] uses this approach. You can find the review [here][bactra].

I am particularly interested in studying intelligence by putting various toy learning agents in different situations and observing their behavior.
