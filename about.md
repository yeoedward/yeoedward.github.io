I studied Computer Science and Statistics at
[Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. I will be working at
[Two Sigma][twosigma] as a Software Engineer starting August 2016.
I interned at Facebook and Google the past two summers.

I am interested in software systems and data analysis. I like thinking about artificial intelligence, computability and their philosophical implications. I want to know more about complex systems.

While I see the world through the lens of science and math, I do not think they answer
the question of how to live. For that, I try to find guidance in the wisdom of ancient
religions and philosophies, and in the lives of those who have done great things. I abide by the philosophy: [Talent is given, Greatness is earned]({% post_url 2016-07-16-rubber-city-soul %}).
