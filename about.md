I studied Computer Science and Statistics at
[Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. I will be working at
[Two Sigma][twosigma] as a Software Engineer starting August 2016.
I interned at Facebook and Google the past two summers.

I am interested in software systems. I've worked on an
[OS kernel][15410] and a [compiler][15411].
Made very small, very minor contributions to a [database][peloton].
Implemented [paxos][15440].

I am also interested in [data analysis][36402] and machine learning.

At the moment, I am learning more about [consciousness]({% post_url 2016-03-30-consc %})
and self-representation, from the standpoints of both machine learning and theory of computation.

Here is my [resume][resume].

I spend a lot of time listening to EDM. I was [here][edc].
